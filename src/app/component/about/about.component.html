                    <h4>My Wallet. My Wallet is an application for anyone of any age and occupation 
                        to manage their finances. Users will manually enter their earnings and spendings and see immediate balance 
                        changes. For usersâ€™ convenience, there will be two separate pages to manage their one-off and recurrent earnings
                         and spendings. There will also be a report page where they can see analytics about their earnings and spendings
                          for a period of time. My Wallet will have easy, intuitive navigation and user-friendly UI. We will store customer 
                          data in MongoDB. Please see further slides for more information about the targeted audience and functionality.</h4>

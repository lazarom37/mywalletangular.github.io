                    <br> Original Pitch: <br>
                    <h4><br>My Wallet is an application for anyone of any age and occupation 
                        to manage their finances. <br>Users will manually enter their earnings and spendings and see immediate balance 
                        changes. <br>For usersâ€™ convenience, there will be two separate pages to manage their one-off and recurrent earnings
                         and spendings. <br>There will also be a report page where they can see analytics about their earnings and spendings
                          for a period of time. <br>My Wallet will have easy, intuitive navigation and user-friendly UI.</h4>
